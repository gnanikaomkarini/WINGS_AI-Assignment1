SCALA - REGISTRATION API CALL
- learnt that the requests module in scala behaves quite like its python counterpart
- the scala code is much easier to write when compared to Haskell
- using session to do cookie managment
- getting error when the player loses the game

SCALA - GUESS API 422 STATUS CODE
- I was getting  an exception when the statusCode is 422
    Exception in thread "main" requests.RequestFailedException: Request to https://wordle.we4shakthi.in/game/guess failed with status code 422
    {"answer":"bajus","feedback":"GGRGR","message":"You have exceeded the number of allowed guesses. Post to /create to create a new game"}
- Found out that by default scala requests library throws an exception for non-2xx status codes
- Now using try except blocks to handle this case

SCALA - WORDLEBOT CODE
- This is very similar to python
- Still was unable to fix the error despite using try except blocks
- For now just using the apis as they are
